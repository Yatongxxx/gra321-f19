    <h1>Before we explored outer space, we tried to paint it</h1>
    <h2>In 1939, artist Charles Bittinger imagined worlds we hadn’t traveled to yet—sometimes with impressive accuracy.</h2>
    <p>Earlier this week, when NASA's New Horizons spacecraft went careening past an ancient chunk of rock more than four billion miles away, science celebrated a milestone—the flyby was the farthest visit to another world humans have made to date. The probe snapped numerous pictures of its target that are now making the long trek back to Earth.</p>
    <p>But of course, no humans were actually there to document the spacecraft's big moment. So, what must that distant encounter have looked like up close? It’s the kind of question astronomers have been asking since they began studying the skies, and one that artists—with their brushes, paints, scientific knowledge, and imaginations—have for centuries been trying to help answer.</p>
    <p>In July 1939, National Geographic published a story called “News of the Universe,” for which artist Charles Bittinger was commissioned to create a series of paintings that would help readers visualize outer space. At the time, telescopes were advanced enough to reveal details of the moon, but it would be another 30 years before a human would set foot there. Not even a satellite had been launched at the time the piece was published. </p>
    <p>Despite the fact that humans hadn’t yet begun to explore outer space, the paintings illuminate how much scientists already understood. In the painting of Earth as seen from the moon, for example, the ridges on the moon’s craters are raised, which planetary scientist Bethany Ehlmann says is “very technically correct.” In another painting, Bittinger depicts the way light scatters into a spectrum of colors. It may seem out of place in the series, but “Bittinger felt it important to illustrate that, to make sure that readers understood the importance of the principle and how it related to the other paintings,” says National Geographic senior graphics editor Jason Treat.</p>
